Commodore VIC20: Omega Race sequel using modern 6502 assembler

This past winter I envisioned making a sequel to the Bally-Midway arcade hit, 
Omega Race, and a favorite among many VIC 20 users when Commodore bought the 
licensing rights to make its home computer versions.  Three months later, I 
released a beta version of the fully playable game.  At the time, I did not 
think I would spend much more time with it, because it was so close to the game 
I thought it could be.

But there lies the problem — it was close.  Again, that feeling of an 
incomplete job, so after a nice break with the Summer days, I came back to this 
personal gaming project and began looking for ways to get it done.  Here is a 
list of changes made that brings the game to a new milestone:

-	some core software sprite library optimizations for speed;
-	energy bolts fired from the Fury’s ship travel faster;
-	energy replenishment was increased to keep the pace of the action 
intense;
-	all Thargoid ships round their turns, rather than jerky N-S-E-W moves;
-	animations for Fury’s death and game over has been re-sequenced to 
incite the user to play again;
-	a new firing solution AI for Thargoid scouts and space carrier.
-	and of course, many bug fixes!

I am pretty excited how these improvements and finishing touches have made the 
game more playable and more appealing.  It has a nice arcade feel to it with 
the progressive, intense action.
